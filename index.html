<!-- 
In my previous JS studies I did not come across the "defer" attribute.
Simply put, using defer ensures that a script runs only when all HTML has been parsed. 
In the example below, the turnBlue script is deferred. 
It will actually run following the turnYellow script. 
The final design of the element would thus be blue, not yellow.


"When the HTML parser encounters a <script> element with the defer attribute, 
it loads the script but defers the actual execution of the JavaScript until 
after it finishes parsing the rest of the elements in the HTML file.
When a script contains functionality that requires interaction with the DOM, 
the defer attribute is the way to go. This way, it ensures that the entire HTML 
file has been parsed before the script is executed." src = codecademy
